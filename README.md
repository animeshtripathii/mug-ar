## 🚀 Overview

**mug-ar** is a lightweight, web-based augmented reality (AR) project that lets you visualize coffee mugs in your real environment right from your browser. Designed with pure HTML (and possibly a touch of JavaScript/CSS), it works without frameworks, making it easy to set up, modify, and deploy. Whether you're a hobbyist, educator, or marketer, mug-ar is a fun and interactive way to showcase mugs or experiment with web-based AR.

---

## ✨ Features

- **100% HTML**: No frameworks needed; just open and use.
- **Augmented Reality**: Place and view virtual mugs using your device’s camera.
- **Fully Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop browsers.
- **Customizable Assets**: Swap out mug images or models in the assets folder.
- **Easy Integration**: Lightweight and embeddable in other projects.

---

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **HTML5** for primary structure and AR embedding.
- **(Optional) JavaScript** for AR interactions, model loading, or camera access.
- **(Optional) CSS** for styling and layout.
- **(Optional) AR Library**: If used, AR.js, Model Viewer, or WebXR for browser-based AR (update this section if your implementation uses a specific library).

---

## ⚡️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/animeshtripathii/mug-ar.git
cd mug-ar
```

### 2. Open the App

- Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- For best results, use a mobile device and allow camera access.
- Some AR features require HTTPS. If you need to serve locally:

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

---

## 🖼️ Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted.
3. Point your camera at a flat surface or AR marker (if the project uses markers).
4. A virtual mug should appear, ready for interaction!
5. Use touch or mouse gestures to rotate, zoom, or switch mug styles (if supported).

---

## 🛠️ Customization

- **Change Mug Assets:** Replace or add images/models in the `assets/` directory.
- **Edit AR Marker:** Update the marker image in `assets/` if your AR implementation uses one.
- **Modify UI/Styles:** Adjust styles in `index.html` or related CSS.
- **Extend Functionality:** Integrate with AR.js, Model Viewer, or Three.js for more advanced features.
